#We will upload the machine learning libraries later
#This way its easier to keep track of uploaded libraries

#Importing the dataset.Here I have left the document source URL empty
#The dataset source will be different for each person

#Most of the time its hard to understand the data by looking at it in a spreadsheet viewer.
#Before I start interacting with the data, I want to conduct some exploratory data analysis
#First, I want to know what the data is, how many columns, rows and data entries are there.
customers.info()

#Next, its a good idea to get to know the types of data that is there in our dataset
#I want to understand what the values are in the columns, whether they have categorical data or not
customers.head()

#Now, we know that there is indeed numerical data (discrete form). I want to have a look at the basic statistical makeup
customers.describe()

#After looking at the basic stat makeup. First I want to know if there is a relationship between the Time on website and the yearly amount spent
sns.jointplot(data = customers, x = 'Time on Website', y = 'Yearly Amount Spent')
#I am going to do the same with Time on App and the yearly amount spent
sns.jointplot(data = customers, x = 'Time on App', y = 'Yearly Amount Spent')
#From the plot there is seems to be some sort of relationship but its hard to tell what kind of relationship.

#Since I am looking at finding any quantitative relationships
#I believe that the easiest way will be to explore the relationships across the entire dataset
sns.pairplot(customers)

#From the above pairplot it seems that there is linear relationship between Yearly Amount Spent and Length of Membership
#Lets see if there is indeed a relationship between the yearly amount spent and length of membership

sns.lmplot(x='Length of Membership',y='Yearly Amount Spent', data= customers)

#From the plot there is a linear relationship between Length of membership and yearly amount spent
#We are going to use linear regression to understand the quantitative relationship

#We will now import the machine learning library, declare X and y matrices and split the data into train and test set

#For this, I am going to create a normal distribution of the residuals
#If the shape matches that of a normal distribution, then I can confirm that the choice of model is accurate
